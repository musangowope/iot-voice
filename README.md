## IoT Voice layout

- Layout for Iot Voice built with tailwindcss
- Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.


## Running TailwindCSS
- Ensure that you have `NPM` installed on your local machine
- Install node modules `npm install`
- To run TailwindCSS run
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./styles/input.css -o ./styles/output.css --watch
```
- Use TailwindCSS helper classes to help with layouts. For more information visit [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
